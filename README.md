# Bowsérmon

This is a project I did at Prime Digital Academy. I worked on this project alone and finished it in a 4 week time frame. The goal was to make a project that includes CRUD and authentication. Also I did add some features and cleaned up some bugs after the deadline was up.

A turn-based game, that is mixed between Mario and Pokemon. That has battles like Pokemon and has the characters of Mario. But the story isn't like the normal Mario games. Instead of playing as Mario while he saves the Princess. You will be playing as Bowser while he steals back the Princess. You will have to buy characters and go level by level until you beat Mario at the end. 

## Demo

The settings button in the top left, will open and show you everything you need.
The users coins will be displayed next to it.
The right shows the starters you currently have in your party.
The buttons on the screen will bring you to the corisponding page.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org)
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io)

## Create Database and Table

Create a new database called `bowsermon` and create a `user` table:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE "user" (
    "id" SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    "username" VARCHAR (80) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    "password" VARCHAR (1000) NOT NULL
);
```

Go to the `database.sql` file and copy and paste everything into SQL

If you would like to name your database something else, you will need to change `bowsermon` to the name of your new database name in `server/modules/pool.js`.

## Development Setup Instructions

- Run `npm install`.
    - Be sure to take stock of `package.json` to see which dependencies you'll need to add.
- Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and paste this line into the file:

```plaintext
SERVER_SESSION_SECRET=superDuperSecret
```

While you're in your new `.env` file, take the time to replace `superDuperSecret` with some long random string like `25POUbVtx6RKVNWszd9ERB9Bb6` to keep your application secure. Here's a site that can help you: [Password Generator Plus](https://passwordsgenerator.net). If you don't do this step, create a secret with less than eight characters, or leave it as `superDuperSecret`, you will get a warning.

- Start postgres if not running already by using opening up the [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com), or if using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) you can use the command `brew services start postgresql`.
- Run `npm run server` to start the server.
- Run `npm run client` to start the client.
- Navigate to `localhost:5173`.
